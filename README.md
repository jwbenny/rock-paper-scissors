Welcome to my first attempt at a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Javascript! As with my other projects, this will be improved at a later date, but I am proud of this one, considering my current skillset. 

The code invokes a game of classic RPS between the user and an "AI". The user is prompted to input 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (case-insensitive) and puts that choice against another randomly-generated choice. This is played in a first-to-three. The game ends when either the player or the AI reaches three wins.
